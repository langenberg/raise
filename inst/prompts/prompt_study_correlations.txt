Give me a reasonable correlation matrix for the independent variables. For the correlation matrix, assume that all variables are continuous (also binary and categorical variables). That is, assume binary and categorical variables have an underlying latent continuous variable. Give me the correlation matrix for the latent variables. The matrix should have as many rows and columns as the number of independent variables (i.e., the sum of continuous, binary and categorical variables). For instance, if I have one continuous, one binary and one categorical variable, the dimensions of the correlation matrix should be 3x3, irrespective of the number of levels of the categorical and binary variables (i.e., disregard the levels of the binary and categorical outcomes). Give me the answer as JSON code and also in R code for a matrix. Your answer should be in a JSON format. Below, you can find an example JSON file from a previous prompt. Please use the same format but insert the variable names from your previous response. Do not change the names of the variables. Change the correlations to reasonable values that fit your example and could well occur in the real world.

Output example:
