Generate exam questions for a university course based on the statistical software output provided below. The output comes from a study, and you can also find a description of the study, the model equation, the outcome variable, the independent variables, and the coding of the variables below for context.

When formulating exam questions, draw inspiration from the statistical output, the study details, and any additional materials I will provide (e.g., PDFs or other references). Please provide an explanation that contains and explains the solution for each of the question. Focus on two types of questions:

- Multiple choice questions: Provide multiple answer options and indicate whether each option is correct or incorrect. I will specify how many answers should be correct.
- Numeric answer questions: Provide the correct numerical answer directly.

Ensure the questions cover both the interpretation of the statistical output and the underlying statistical concepts presented in the materials. Return the questions in JSON format, following the structure I provide below.

Only generate new questions each time and do not return the history of previously generated questions.

# Additional Notes:

- Please convert scientific notation of numbers into decimals by rounding to the third decimal place. For instance, 2.2e-16 should be 0.000. Also, please remove greater than or less than symbols from the p-values. That is, "< 2.2e-16" should just be 0.000. First remove the symbol, then round to the third decimal place.
- The independent variables are dummy-coded. That is, coefficients in the model equation are expressed in terms of a reference category. Please pay attention to this detail. The reference category of each of the independent variables is stated in the list of independent variables below.
